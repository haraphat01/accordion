# Accordion React is a simple and lightweight npm package that allows developers to easily add an accordion UI to their React projects.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

To install the package, simply run the following command in your project's root directory:
npm install accordion-react

## Usage
In your project's entry file (e.g. index.js), import the package:

javascript

import { Accordion } from 'accordion-react';

Then, you can use the Accordion component in your JSX:

javascript

    <Accordion title="Section 1">
        <p>Content for section 1</p>
    </Accordion>

## Props
The Accordion component accepts the following props:

    title (string): The title of the accordion section.
    defaultOpen (boolean): Whether the accordion section should be open by default. Default is false.
    onClick (function): A callback function that is called when the accordion section is clicked.

## Styling
The package uses inline styling, so you can easily customize the look and feel of the accordion by passing in inline styles to the Accordion component.


## Note

You can add as many accordion sections as you want by using the Accordion component multiple times.


## Support

If you have any questions or issues, please feel free to open an issue on the package's GitHub page.
